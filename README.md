A small python/flask-based project to use RPi 2b as a smart home gateway accessible from internet.

It begins with home air quality and temperature/humidity monitoring, controlling Xiaomi air purifier in an indirect way by manipulating its sensor reading wirelessly via bluetooth. After that, new features are added such as sending keep-alive packets for NAS, launching XBMC on RPi 2b for media streaming and changing source, volumn and power mode of AV receiver.
